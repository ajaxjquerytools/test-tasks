Given a sequence, write a program to detect cycles within it.

Input sample:
A file containing a sequence of numbers (space delimited). The file can have multiple such lines. e.g

2 0 6 3 1 6 3 1 6 3 1
Ensure to account for numbers that have more than one digit eg. 12. If there is no sequence, ignore that line.

Output sample:
Print to stdout the first sequence you find in each line. Ensure that there are no trailing empty spaces on each line you print. e.g.

6 3 1
